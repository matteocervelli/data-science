## ‚òïÔ∏è Buy me a coffee

This project resolves a problem for me, to build a consistent structure that I would use both as a general system for all my development and as a boilerplate for my specific full-stack applications.

I used many open-source tools and services to build this project, and I'm grateful for their availability. So consider funding their projects.

However, if my work was useful to you and saves you time, consider buying me a coffee.
